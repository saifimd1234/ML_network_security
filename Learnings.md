The use of `if __name__ == "__main__":` in Python determines whether a script is being run directly or being imported as a module. However, in your case, whether you include it or not, you are running `python setup.py`, which executes the script in the same way each time, so you see the same result.

### **Understanding `if __name__ == "__main__":`**
- Every Python script has a built-in variable called `__name__`.
- When a script runs directly (e.g., `python setup.py`), `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`, so the code inside `if __name__ == "__main__":` executes.
- If the script is imported as a module into another script, `__name__` is set to the script's filename (not `"__main__"`), and the code inside this block does **not** execute automatically.

### **When Does It Make a Difference?**
If you import your script in another Python file, the behavior will change.

#### **Example Without `if __name__ == "__main__":`**
**File: `setup.py`**
```python
from typing import List

def get_requirements() -> List[str]:
    """Reads requirements.txt and returns a list of dependencies."""
    requirement_lst: List[str] = []
    try:
        with open('requirements.txt', 'r') as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
            for line in lines:
                requirement = line.strip()
                if requirement and requirement != '-e .':
                    requirement_lst.append(requirement)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print('Requirements file not found.')
    
    return requirement_lst

print(get_requirements())  # This runs every time the file is imported
```

**File: `test.py`**
```python
import setup  # Importing setup.py
```
#### **Output when running `python test.py`:**
```
['requirement1', 'requirement2', ...]  # (This prints automatically when test.py is run)
```
- Here, `print(get_requirements())` is executed **immediately** when `setup.py` is imported, which is often **not desired**.

---

#### **Example With `if __name__ == "__main__":`**
**Modified `setup.py`**
```python
from typing import List

def get_requirements() -> List[str]:
    """Reads requirements.txt and returns a list of dependencies."""
    requirement_lst: List[str] = []
    try:
        with open('requirements.txt', 'r') as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
            for line in lines:
                requirement = line.strip()
                if requirement and requirement != '-e .':
                    requirement_lst.append(requirement)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print('Requirements file not found.')
    
    return requirement_lst

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(get_requirements())  # This runs ONLY when executed directly
```

**File: `test.py`**
```python
import setup  # Importing setup.py
```

#### **Output when running `python test.py`:**
```
(Nothing prints because `print(get_requirements())` is inside `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
```

- **Now, `setup.py` does not execute `print(get_requirements())` when imported into another script.** 
- This is useful when writing reusable modules.

### **Summary**
- If you run `python setup.py` directly, it behaves the same with or without `if __name__ == "__main__":` because Python executes the file.
- If you **import** the script into another file, the code inside `if __name__ == "__main__":` does **not** execute, preventing unintended behavior.

Let me know if you need further clarification! ðŸš€

Great question! Letâ€™s break it down and explore how `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` interact and the purpose of the `-e .` flag.

### **How `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` Are Connected**

1. **Purpose of `setup.py`**:
   - `setup.py` is a Python script used to package and distribute your Python project. It provides metadata (name, version, dependencies, etc.) about your project and enables tools like `pip` or `setuptools` to install it.
   - It specifies dependencies that your package requires through the `install_requires` parameter in the `setup()` function. For example:
     ```python
     setup(
         name='MyProject',
         version='1.0',
         install_requires=[
             'numpy',
             'pandas',
             'scikit-learn'
         ]
     )
     ```

2. **Purpose of `requirements.txt`**:
   - `requirements.txt` is typically used to list all dependencies (packages and their versions) for a project. When you run:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     Pip installs all the packages listed in the file into the environment.

3. **How They Interact**:
   - If `requirements.txt` contains `-e .` (editable mode), it tells `pip` to look at the `setup.py` file in the current directory (`.`) to install the project. This effectively connects `requirements.txt` with `setup.py`.
   - When `pip` encounters `-e .`, it installs the package as an editable package and uses the metadata and dependency information from `setup.py` to resolve dependencies.

---

### **What Does `-e .` Do?**

1. **Editable Mode**:
   - The `-e .` flag means "install this package in editable mode."
   - In editable mode, the project files remain in their original location (rather than being copied to a site-packages directory). Any changes you make to the source files are immediately reflected without reinstalling the package.

2. **Why Is It Useful?**
   - Itâ€™s particularly useful during development, as it allows you to work on your project and test it without reinstalling the package every time you make changes.
   - For example:
     - If youâ€™re writing a library or package, you can keep modifying the code and still use it as if itâ€™s installed without re-running `pip install`.

3. **How `setup.py` Works with `-e .`**:
   - When you run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `-e .` is listed, Pip looks at the `setup.py` file in the current directory (`.`) and processes the project as a package.
   - Dependencies listed in `install_requires` in `setup.py` are automatically installed.

---

### **Example**

#### File: `setup.py`
```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="example_package",
    version="0.1",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        "numpy==1.21.0",
        "pandas>=1.3.0"
    ]
)
```

#### File: `requirements.txt`
```
-e .
requests==2.25.1
```

#### Command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### What Happens:
1. Pip sees `-e .` in `requirements.txt`:
   - It processes `setup.py` to install the project `example_package` in editable mode.
   - It installs the dependencies listed in `install_requires` of `setup.py` (i.e., `numpy` and `pandas`).
2. Pip also installs the additional dependency specified in `requirements.txt` (i.e., `requests`).

---

### **Key Points to Remember**
- `setup.py` is for packaging and distributing your project, and `install_requires` specifies dependencies.
- `requirements.txt` is for explicitly listing dependencies for installation.
- The `-e .` flag in `requirements.txt` ties it to `setup.py`, enabling editable installation.
